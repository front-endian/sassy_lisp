# Sassy LISP
A LISP, complete with anonymous functions, implemented in entirely using pure `SASS`!

At the moment this is a very naive `LISP`, but it does have anonymous functions (which `SASS` lacks), those anonymous functions do act as closures, you have local and global variables, a tiny standard library, AND you can call any `SASS` functions from the `LISP`!

I will be extending it in the future so you can write `LISP` that returns `CSS` instead of only being able to return values.

**Note:** this is not a serious library. It was not intended for production use, only as a joke and to prove it can be done. If you do use it, let me know!
